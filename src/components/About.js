          Island Time Kids is directed by Cheryl Snyder. Our caring, skilled
          staff provide activities that assist children with strong, positive
          personal development, values exploration, decision making as well as
          opportunities for interacting with each other. Through a full range of
          educational, recreational and social activities, our program is
          designed to provide a balance between structure and spontaneity in a
          fun-loving community atmosphere. Games, crafts, drama, science,
          homework assistance, meditation, yoga, self-defense classes, free play
          and specialty classes are just some of the activities your child will
          have the opportunity to experience at Island Time Kids.
